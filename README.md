# react_webpack

After trying repeatedly, reading documentation and copying freely from the web I found a solution to how to run webpack in combination with raect.

This code works. You only need to do exaclty 2 things.

#npm install
#npm run dev (this will start your app on port 8080)

Go to http://localhost:8080
